I used override in making a new - operater symbol. I created this so that instead of adding two instances of arrays together we do the opposite and remove the second array from whatever may be in the first. This works because we loop through the first of array with each object contained in the second array to determine what to remove from the first. When you do this method you create a new array that is only the remaining objects after cycling through the array. An example to this would be arrayOne {1,2,3} - arrayTwo (1,2}. This would return a new array that would look like {3}. The return type of the new array, always be the same type as the two arrays you started with.
